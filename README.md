## EKS
Build EKS from Zero by Terraform 

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/startups/from-zero-to-eks-with-terraform-and-helm/

## Universal Solution to Build K8s across Hybrid Platforms

Terraform => Rancher => Helm => Istio

1. Build Rancher by Terraform

Option #1: Use Terraform service provider of rancher https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/rancher/index.html

Option #2: Use Rancher OS Image https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/quick-start-guide/deployment/


2. Build K8s cluster by Rancher (on VM, Vagrant, EKS, AKS, GKS)
